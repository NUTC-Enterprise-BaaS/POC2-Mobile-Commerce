## Application Themes (This is currently not supported yet)
Application themes allows user to choose specific themes that the application has to offer. At this point of time, this isn't supported yet. 

Since theme support isn't added yet, your theme files should be placed in the `default` folder. In this example, the theme folder should be located in the following location:

`/media/com_easysocial/apps/user/APP_NAME/themes/default`
