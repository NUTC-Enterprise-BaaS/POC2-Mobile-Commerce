Info about report translations

Each report has 2 ini files in the folder components\com_fss\language\en-GB\
A sys file that only contains the name and description of the report named en-GB.report_XXXX.sys.ini
A ini file that contains all other translation entries for the report names en-GB.report_XXXX.ini
XXX is the name of the report (ie, list_tickets.xml has files en-GB.report_list_tickets.ini and en-GB.report_list_tickets.sys.ini)

Also, entries that are common to several reports are found in the en-GB.report_shared.ini file.

For the report list, the .sys.ini file for each report is loaded.
For displaying the report, the .sys.ini file, the .ini file and the report_shared.ini files are loaded

To translate, you need to create the relevant language sub folder and translate the ini files as you would with a normal component
